# Table-driven-scanners
<p> Table-driven scanners in Java, exporting DFA's from csv files</p>

<p>->table driven scanner</p>
<p>->direct coded scanner</p>
<p>->maximal munch scanner</p>
<p>->dfa class which gathers data from csv files to respective data structures</p>
<p>->test class which contains the main driver code</p>

More Infos:
Table-driven scanners utilize some tables that encode language-specific information. To put it blankly, the code uses tables that encode information about the syntactic categories, the transition function, and the token type all of which are for the sake of simulating the DFA for each input.
